# AquaQuartz
A (WIP) proxy for connecting LAN games. Part of the proxy must be hosted on fly.io, but can be done for free. TCP currently works, still adding support for UDP. 

The program is not in a working condition as I'm currently in the process of setting up UDP, which has broken a lot of the code.
